Version 3.0.0 (2022-02)
=======================

The scene has changed; pip is no longer king, poetry delivers a better experience
with much less confusion when packaging a library or project.  PEPs 517 and 518 replace
the old setup.py file with the new pyproject.toml.

We now adapt to all this, keeping compatibility with the old way.

- The InteractivelyApproveDistribution and InteractivelyApproveWheel commands are no more,
  having been replaced by a single InteractivelyApprovePackage which confirms only once,
  after one or two shell commands build the sdist and wheel -- see our
  example ``release_new_version.py`` for details.
- PypiUpload command has been renamed to TwineUploadSource; but if you use poetry you
  don't need Twine, since poetry can upload.
- PypiUploadWheel has been renamed to TwineUploadWheel; but if you use poetry you
  shouldn't use this, since you can just do ``poetry publish``.


Version 2.0.0 (2021-02)
=======================

When you upgrade to this version you need to reposition 2 build steps.

**releaser** now uses **twine** to upload packages to pypi. There is no longer
a need to build a test package before releasing. So these 2 steps which were
preparation steps::

    InteractivelyApproveDistribution,  # Generate sdist, let user verify it
    InteractivelyApproveWheel,         # Generate wheel, let user verify it

â€¦are now expected to appear in the RELEASE (middle) part of your script.
Move them down in the list of steps.  In 1.x these steps built a
test package; in 2.x they build the actual package that will be uploaded
to pypi.

Refer to our updated `example script`_.
