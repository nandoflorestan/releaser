Version 2.0.0
=============

When you upgrade to this version you need to reposition 2 build steps.

**releaser** now uses **twine** to upload packages to pypi. There is no longer
a need to build a test package before releasing. So these 2 steps which were
preparation steps::

    InteractivelyApproveDistribution,  # Generate sdist, let user verify it
    InteractivelyApproveWheel,         # Generate wheel, let user verify it

â€¦are now expected to appear in the RELEASE (middle) part of your script.
Move them down in the list of steps.  In 1.x these steps built a
test package; in 2.x they build the actual package that will be uploaded
to pypi.

Refer to our updated `example script`_.
